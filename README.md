## 🧩 What It Does

This tool helps you:
- **Decrypt** Vigenère-encoded text (if you know or can guess the key)
- **Reverse-engineer** ciphertext to reveal hidden messages
- **Brute-force** potential keys (optional enhancement)
- **Save & export** results for analysis

Perfect for beginners and pros alike who love cracking codes!
